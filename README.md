## Project Title: Portfolio Simulator
üîç Description of the Work
The Portfolio Simulator is a Python-based tool designed to model and forecast the performance of a stock or investment portfolio over time using real-world data and simulations. It allows users to:

## Key Functionalities:
Simulate Portfolio Performance

Allows users to input multiple assets (e.g., stocks, ETFs) and their corresponding weights.

Generates randomized or historical simulations of how the portfolio may perform over a set period.

Monte Carlo Simulation

Uses Monte Carlo techniques to run thousands of possible market scenarios.

Shows possible outcomes and risk of loss or gain in the portfolio.

Interactive Visualization

Graphs showing the range of simulated outcomes.

Probability distributions and cumulative return plots.

Helps in understanding risk, return, and diversification benefits.

Data Integration

Fetches real stock data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance using yfinance).

Calculates returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, etc.

Output & Export

Optionally saves charts and summaries.

Can be integrated into dashboards (e.g., Streamlit) or exported as reports.

## Technologies Used:
Python (Core Logic)

Pandas / NumPy (Data handling)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)

Git / GitHub (Version control and collaboration)

Optionally: streamlit, yfinance, scikit-learn for additional functionality

## Use Cases:
Students or professionals learning about portfolio theory.

Finance analysts simulating future investment outcomes.

Risk managers exploring potential downside scenarios.
